= Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Embassy provides HAL's for several microcontroller families:

* embassy-nrf for the nRF family of devices from Nordic Semiconductor
* embassy-stm32 for STM32 family of devices from ST Microelectronics
* embassy-rp for Raspberry Pi Pico

These HALs provide async/await access to most peripherals while also implementing the async traits in Embassy.
