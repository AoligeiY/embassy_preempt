*                                  CREATE A TASK (Extended Version)
*
* Description: This function is used to have uC/OS-II manage the execution of a task.  Tasks can either
*              be created prior to the start of multitasking or by a running task.  A task cannot be
*              created by an ISR.  This function is similar to OSTaskCreate() except that it allows
*              additional information about a task to be specified.
*
* Arguments  : task      is a pointer to the task's code
*
*              p_arg     is a pointer to an optional data area which can be used to pass parameters to
*                        the task when the task first executes.  Where the task is concerned it thinks
*                        it was invoked and passed the argument 'p_arg' as follows:
*
*                            void Task (void *p_arg)
*                            {
*                                for (;;) {
*                                    Task code;
*                                }
*                            }
*
*              ptos      is a pointer to the task's top of stack.  If the configuration constant
*                        OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 1, the stack is assumed to grow downward (i.e. from high
*                        memory to low memory).  'ptos' will thus point to the highest (valid) memory
*                        location of the stack.  If OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 0, 'ptos' will point to the
*                        lowest memory location of the stack and the stack will grow with increasing
*                        memory locations.  'ptos' MUST point to a valid 'free' data item.
*
*              prio      is the task's priority.  A unique priority MUST be assigned to each task and the
*                        lower the number, the higher the priority.
*
*              id        is the task's ID (0..65535)
*
*              pbos      is a pointer to the task's bottom of stack.  If the configuration constant
*                        OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 1, the stack is assumed to grow downward (i.e. from high
*                        memory to low memory).  'pbos' will thus point to the LOWEST (valid) memory
*                        location of the stack.  If OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 0, 'pbos' will point to the
*                        HIGHEST memory location of the stack and the stack will grow with increasing
*                        memory locations.  'pbos' MUST point to a valid 'free' data item.
*
*              stk_size  is the size of the stack in number of elements.  If OS_STK is set to INT8U,
*                        'stk_size' corresponds to the number of bytes available.  If OS_STK is set to
*                        INT16U, 'stk_size' contains the number of 16-bit entries available.  Finally, if
*                        OS_STK is set to INT32U, 'stk_size' contains the number of 32-bit entries
*                        available on the stack.
*
*              pext      is a pointer to a user supplied memory location which is used as a TCB extension.
*                        For example, this user memory can hold the contents of floating-point registers
*                        during a context switch, the time each task takes to execute, the number of times
*                        the task has been switched-in, etc.
*
*              opt       contains additional information (or options) about the behavior of the task.  The
*                        LOWER 8-bits are reserved by uC/OS-II while the upper 8 bits can be application
*                        specific.  See OS_TASK_OPT_??? in uCOS-II.H.  Current choices are:
*
*                        OS_TASK_OPT_STK_CHK      Stack checking to be allowed for the task
*                        OS_TASK_OPT_STK_CLR      Clear the stack when the task is created
*                        OS_TASK_OPT_SAVE_FP      If the CPU has floating-point registers, save them
*                                                 during a context switch.
*
* Returns    : OS_ERR_NONE                     if the function was successful.
*              OS_ERR_PRIO_EXIST               if the task priority already exist
*                                              (each task MUST have a unique priority).
*              OS_ERR_PRIO_INVALID             if the priority you specify is higher that the maximum
*                                              allowed (i.e. > OS_LOWEST_PRIO)
*              OS_ERR_TASK_CREATE_ISR          if you tried to create a task from an ISR.
*              OS_ERR_ILLEGAL_CREATE_RUN_TIME  if you tried to create a task after safety critical
*                                              operation started.
